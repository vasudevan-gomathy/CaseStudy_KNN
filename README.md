# CaseStudy_KNN

## Summary

In this casestudy, KNN (K Nearest Neighbor) algorithm is used for analysing amd predicitng the target variable.

K nearest neighbour (KNN) is one of the most widely used and simplest algorithms for classification problems under supervised Machine Learning. 
KNN(K-nearest neighbours) is a supervised learning and non-parametric algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problem statements.

It uses data in which there is a target column present i.e, labelled data to model a function to produce an output for the unseen data. It uses the euclidean distance formula to compute the distance between the data points for classification or prediction.

## About the Dataset

This dataset contains information of users in a social network. Those informations are the user id the gender the age and the estimated salary. A car company has just launched their brand new luxury SUV. And we're trying to see which of these users of the social network are going to buy this brand new SUV And the last column here tells If yes or no the user bought this SUV we are going to build a model that is going to predict if a user is going to buy or not the SUV based on two variables which are going to be the age and the estimated salary. So our matrix of feature is only going to be these two columns. We want to find some correlations between the age and the estimated salary of a user and his decision to purchase yes or no the SUV.

## Evaluating the Model

The below Confusion Matrix evaluates the KNN Model:
